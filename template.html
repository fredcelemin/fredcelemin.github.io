          <h3>The Company</h3>
          <p>Diatom Impact is a new venture started by Platform Capital Investment Partners, a venture capital firm based in Lagos, Nigeria. It is a non-profit organization with the mission of working at an ecosystem level to improve the
            everyday lives of Nigerian citizens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="context">
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>This project will focus on the creation and application of a UI treatment for the front end of the website so that Diatom impact can partner and engage with multi-national and international organizations to fund social impact projects in
            partnership with local leaders.</p>
          <h3>The Problem in Detail</h3>
          <p>Diatom Impact needs help in creating and applying a visual treatment that communicates professionalism, integrity, trust, and social responsibility because Nigeria has a stereotype of being full of scammers; this stereotype needs to be
            overcome, They want to partner with Foundations/CSRs to be persuaded to invest in Africa (and Nigeria specifically).</p>

      <h3>Interview Round 1 (styles tiles)</h3>

      <p>Interviews will give us insights into what users think about a site, an application, a product, or a process. They can point out what site content is memorable, what people feel is important on the site, and what ideas for improvement they
        may have. For these interviews we wanted:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to inform personas, journey maps, feature ideas, workflow ideas</li>
        <li>to enrich a contextual inquiry study by supplementing observation with descriptions of tools, processes, and how users perceive the Style Tiles</li>
        <li>to collect verbal responses related to observed behaviors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Interviews help you gain a deeper understanding of people’s behavior and their reason why they do what they do.</p>

      <p>For this round, we interviewed a total of user provided By the client who are associated with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Foundations</li>
        <li>CSR departments with interest in international activities</li>

      <h2>Analyzing wireframes</h2>

      <p>Our client provided us the wireframes used for the actual website, Based on this we had the start point to design our first round of design concepts.</p>

      <h2>Round 1</h2>
      <p>At this point, and based on the feedback gathered from the style tiles I determined to follow a single design direction and create hi-fidelity designs of the current product state adding visuals that speak a cohesive design language and add
        significant value to the user experience.</p>

          <p>Interviews will give us insights into what users think about a site, an application, a product, or a process. They can point out what site content is memorable, what people feel is important on the site, and what ideas for improvement
            they
            may have. For these interviews, we will get feedback from users about our first round of Hi Fidelity Designs.</p>

      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY & PROTOTYPE ROUND 2</h2>


      <p>Now that I’ve gained valuable user insight on my designs, I’ll want to make some research-backed design decisions in the form of iterations. The goal is to further develop and polish my existing designs in a way that establishes the visual
        aesthetic of the Diatom Impact. Each design decision and iteration was supported by solid reasoning, best practices, testing insights and project goals. </p>

          <h3>High fidelity mockups</h3>

          <p>For this round of design the main iterations were focused on cleaning the design providing simplicity, Round 1 was overloaded with microinteraction that hid value information for users, that’s why the biggest improvements were based on
            hierarchy, balance and information clearly.</p>

          <p>The content keeps being a block on the process because users don't feel convinced to enroll into Diatom Impact, they want to learn more about the organization.</p>

          <h5>Solution:</h5>

          <p>For the final design I decided to incorporate call the actions around the sections to give users the opportunity to learn more about Diatom Impact .</p>

          <p>The Final design was presented with CTA’s around, this was crucial for users because make them feel that they had the opportunity to learn more about DIATOM IMPACT some users based on Nigeria feel that the imagery and used was accurate
            to
            understand what the organization does and the way to get involved as a user or as a investor.</p>

      <h2 class="unnumbered">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>This project was very valuable to myself and I enjoyed working with a team of individuals to create a product for a Diatom Impact. Our client Anna was an absolute pleasure to work with and was very helpful every step of the way in providing
        the team with what we required or anything additional that we needed.</p>

      <p>It was a great learning experience and our team grew and actively learned together, and from each other. We were also able to effectively adapt to the situations or roadblocks that we experienced in a timely and collaborative manner. We
        worked extremely well as a team and I am very thankful for my team members. I learned a lot from them and from Flatiron School in general through this project, especially the instructors.</p>
