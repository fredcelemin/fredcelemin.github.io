      <p class="intro">Diatom Impact is a new venture started by Platform Capital Investment Partners, a venture capital firm based in Lagos, Nigeria. It is a non-profit organization with the mission of working at an ecosystem level to improve the
        everyday lives of Nigerian citizens.</p>
      <h2>The challenge</h2>
      <p>This project will focus on the creation and application of a UI treatment for the front end of the website so that Diatom impact can partner and engage with multi-national and international organizations to fund social impact projects in
        partnership with local leaders.</p>
      <h2>The Problem in detail</h2>
      <p>Diatom Impact needs help in creating and applying a visual treatment that communicates professionalism, integrity, trust, and social responsibility because Nigeria has a stereotype of being full of scammers; this stereotype needs to be
        overcome, They want to partner with Foundations/CSRs to be persuaded to invest in Africa (and Nigeria specifically).</p>

      <p>The first meeting was crucial in our initial part of the process to understand our client’s needs.</p>

      <p>A proto persona is a fictional character generated based on who you think your user is. and then to know about users: behaviors, needs, demographics, and information.</p>

      <p>We wanted to make sure we design this site to attract the right users.</p>

      <h3>Design principles</h3>

      <p>As a team, We discuss different web design principles that will make the website aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, engaging, and effective.</p>

    <section id="moodboards-section">
      <h2>Moodboards</h2>
      <p>Using the proto persona results and the competitive analysis insights, we decided to go and design moodboards. We also decided to use the colors of the actual logo give our client a variety of options to choose from and give her the option
        to choose different elements that she liked from each direction.</p>

      <h3>Moodboard 1</h3>
      <p>The first direction I decided to go was with a focus on human connection, and the mood conveyed through the moodboard was appropriate for the target audience because it represents education, opportunities inclusion, protection, gender
        equality. The adjectives for the moodboard represent:</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Adjectives:</h4>
        <li>Modern</li>
        <li>Natural</li>
        <li>Collaborative</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/moodboard-1.png" alt="">

      <h3>Moodboard 2</h3>
      <p>This moodboard represents teamwork, collaboration, education, equality and inclusion. The adjectives used for this moodboard were:</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Adjectives:</h4>
        <li>Professional</li>
        <li>Impactful</li>
        <li>Reflective</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/moodboard-2.png" alt="">

      <h3>Moodboard 3</h3>

        <h4>Adjectives:</h4>
        <li>Inviting</li>
        <li>Friendly</li>
        <li>Optimistic</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/moodboard-3.png" alt="">

      <h3>Final Direction (next step “Style tiles”)</h3>
      <p>Once the moodboards were presented and approved by the client I had the direction to continue on my style tiles.</p>

    <section id="style-tiles-section">
      <h2>Style tiles</h2>
      <p>
        Combining fonts, colors, and interface elements helped me to communicate the essence of a visual brand of Diatom Impact. These style Tiles helped me to form a common visual language between me and the client to provide a catalyst for
        discussions around the preferences and goals of the client.
      </p>

      <h3>Style Tile 1</h3>
      <p>The look and feel of this Style Tile are appropriate for the target audience because represent education, opportunities inclusion, protection, gender equality.</p>

      <ul>
        <h4>Adjectives:</h4>
        <li>Modern</li>
        <li>Natural</li>
        <li>Collaborative</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/style-tile-1.png" alt="">

      <h3>Style Tile 2</h3>
      <p>This Style Tile represents freedom of expression, and equality and inclusion and I decided to add the logo as an element to deliver professionalism:</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Emotions:</h4>
        <li>Enthusiasm</li>
        <li>Enjoyment</li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Adjectives:</h4>

        <li>Reflective</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/style-tile-2.png" alt="">

      <h3>Style Tile 3</h3>
      <p>Represent women in tech, education. I decided to include the value propositions to make the concept feel more personal.</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Emotions:</h4>
        <li>Inspiration</li>
        <li>Confidence</li>

      </ul>
      <img src="../assets/style-tile-3.png" alt="">

      <h3>Final Direction</h3>
      <p>Once the style tile was presented and approved by the client I had the direction to continue on my style tyles the style tile with major approval was:</p>

      <h3>Interview Round 1 (styles tiles)</h3>

      <p>Interviews will give us insights into what users think about a site, an application, a product, or a process. They can point out what site content is memorable, what people feel is important on the site, and what ideas for improvement they
        may have. For these interviews we wanted:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>to inform personas, journey maps, feature ideas, workflow ideas</li>
        <li>to enrich a contextual inquiry study by supplementing observation with descriptions of tools, processes, and how users perceive the Style Tiles</li>
        <li>to collect verbal responses related to observed behaviors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Interviews help you gain a deeper understanding of people’s behavior and their reason why they do what they do.</p>

      <p>For this round, we interviewed a total of user provided By the client who are associated with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Foundations</li>
        <li>CSR departments with interest in international activities</li>
        <li>International development agencies</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="../assets/style-tile-insights.png" alt="">

      <h4>Insights</h4>

      <p>Users find my style Tiles with clear Layout, the Style Tile B was well received and approachable they find the design easy to understand, they love the hero image, good contrast and bold, the use of UI elements ( Icons and CTA’S) could be
        displayed in a way that users can understand, the headers need to be used in Sans Serif, the body text was readable the Style tile C was found unclear and hard to understand, the information given wasn’t enough for participants, Different
        styles in one page could be distracted, the hero image is nice, the information displayed was unclear, the contrast and balance between elements are good.</p>

    <section id="analyzing-wireframes-section">
      <h2>Analyzing wireframes</h2>

      <p>Our client provided us the wireframes used for the actual website, Based on this we had the start point to design our first round of design concepts.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="round-1-section">
      <h2>Round 1</h2>

      <p>At this point, and based on the feedback gathered from the style tiles I determined to follow a single design direction and create hi-fidelity designs of the current product state adding visuals that speak a cohesive design language and add
        significant value to the user experience.</p>

      <h3>High fidelity mockups</h3>

      <p>Using the brand colors I incorporate different elements to approach our users with photography, iconography, CTA’s and facts that eventually will inform juicers what Diatom Impact does.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Interview Round 2 (High fidelity & Prototype)</h3>

      <p>Interviews will give us insights into what users think about a site, an application, a product, or a process. They can point out what site content is memorable, what people feel is important on the site, and what ideas for improvement they
        may have. For these interviews, we will get feedback from users about our first round of Hi Fidelity Designs.</p>

      <h4>INSIGHTS</h4>
      <p>With a total of 6 interviews I got positives feedbacks and opportunities to make interactions on my design.</p>

      <ul>
        <h5>Top 3 Positives:</h5>
        <li>Photography (treatment and use)</li>
        <li>Icons (intuitive and clear)</li>

    <section id="round-2-section">
      <h2>HIGH FIDELITY & PROTOTYPE ROUND 2</h2>

      <p>Now that I’ve gained valuable user insight on my designs, I’ll want to make some research-backed design decisions in the form of iterations. The goal is to further develop and polish my existing designs in a way that establishes the visual
        aesthetic of the Diatom Impact. Each design decision and iteration was supported by solid reasoning, best practices, testing insights and project goals. </p>

      <h3>High fidelity mockups</h3>

      <p>For this round of design the main iterations were focused on cleaning the design providing simplicity, Round 1 was overload with microinteracrion that hide value information for users, that’s why tje biggest improvements were based on
        hierarchy, balance and information clearly.</p>

      <h3>Final Interview Round 3 (High fidelity & Prototype)</h3>

      <p>Interviews will give us insights into what users think about a site, an application, a product, or a process. They can point out what site content is memorable, what people feel is important on the site, and what ideas for improvement they
        may have. For these interviews, we will get feedback from users about our first round of Hi Fidelity Designs.</p>

      <h4>INSIGHTS</h4>
      <p>I got positive feedback and opportunities to make interactions with my design.</p>

      <ul>
        <h5>Top 3 Positives:</h5>
        <li>Photography: Treatment and use</li>
        <li>Iconography informative</li>
        <li>Clear Calls To Action</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Blockers:</h5>

      <p>The content keeps being a block on the process because user don't feel convinced to enroll into Diatom Impact, they want to learn more about the organization.</p>

      <h5>Solution:</h5>

      <p>For the final design I decide to incorporate call the action around the sections to give user the opportunity to learn more about Diatom Impact .</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>This project was very valuable to myself and I enjoyed working with a team of individuals to create a product for a Diatom Impact. Our client Anna was an absolute pleasure to work with and was very helpful every step of the way in providing
        the team with what we required or anything additional that we needed.</p>

      <p>It was a great learning experience and our team grew and actively learned together, and from each other. We were also able to effectively adapt to the situations or roadblocks that we experienced in a timely and collaborative manner. We
        worked extremely well as a team and I am very thankful for my team members. I learned a lot from them and from Flatiron School in general through this project, especially the instructors.</p>
